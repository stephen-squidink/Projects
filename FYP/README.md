Final Year Project
==================

The games industry is expanding and people are demanding and expecting more from games.  There is a high demand in realism, especially in simulations like racing and flight games. Simulation games were always found interesting on how they can simulate real world environments in games, but there are always unrealistic features. The understanding on how some simulations can be rated better than others is immeasurable in terms of realism, but most were concluded how one game was more realistic than the other. In the real world a lot of simulations are driven from complex maths and physics, so most simulation game types should really be the same, as they should use the same math and physic concepts. 

------

Driving simulations always had a problem with realism, most game companies focused on either the games realism or the racing aspects. The consumers are always demanding more from racing games, and realism is always a high demand, but it does depend on the market groups, so people under 18 wouldn’t know how to drive, so how would they know what realistic driving is, so would probably demand more on the racing and fun aspects, whereas over 18’s do, so they would probably demand more on the realism aspects.

------

The real world in games has always considered physic concepts and tries to implement them the best they can. With racing games they use vehicle dynamics as its base physics engine, to determine the speed of the car, and what can affect the car at these speeds. Racing games should use the same laws of physics and vehicle dynamics, so therefore the implementation of vehicle dynamics in racing simulations should really be similar between different games, so what actually differentiates racing simulations?  

------

From this problem, the project will be implementing a physics engine that simulates a car on a track where the user can control the car with a gaming steering wheel, but with physics realism. The study will be researching on vehicle dynamics to look at what can affect a car at certain speeds, turns, braking, road surfaces etc. The end goal is to be able to show a 3D application that can simulate the physics of racing and realism.
